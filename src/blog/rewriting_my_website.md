## rewriting everything in rust!
everyone knows **software written in rust is simply superior** to software written in other programming languages, this also applies to my personal website.


after all, this means rust is also the best language to create a **personal home page** with.

harnessing the ancient and unknowable powers of [rocket](https://rocket.rs), [diesel](https://diesel.rs/), [maud](https://maud.lambda.xyz/) and **the borrow checker**, this dream has finally become reality!


**it is now better than every other website** (including **yours**) and all of those should also be rewritten in rust as well.

## WOW! new features!
with this rewrite come many amazing new features, such as **the ability to meow at blogposts** (important), **tags** (i think they look very cool!) and the **switch from rss to atom** (sorry if that broke anything)

## it does the things!
it was really fun to build everything by hand and so far i'm pretty happy with the results!


 the only thing that's a bit messed up and evil is that i need to have postgres running just for the meow button
