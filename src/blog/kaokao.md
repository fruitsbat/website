![a gif showing how kaokao works, an emoji is being picked from a list](/assets/kaokao.gif)

## no kaomoji grrrrrrr
ok so, kaomoji are great

and some emoji pickers have support for adding **custom characters**, but it's usually **very annoying**.

so i decided to make my own!

## features
- adding kaomoji via files
  - support for csv
  - support for json
- tons of builtin kaomoji and emoji (all the unicode ones)

## install
u can [build it from git](https://github.com/zoe-bat/kaokao) or use the nix flake
